Each embedding is a vector of floating point numbers, such that the distance between two embeddings in the vector space is correlated with semantic similarity between two inputs in the original format.

Instead, we can **vectorize the chunks as users search for or discover documents.** This approach ensures that we allocate funds and resources only when the documents are actually required. Typically, in an organization with a vast repository of documents in a data lake, only 20% of the documents are frequently accessed, while the rest remain untouched.

We show that for every fixed integer k, there is a linear-time algorithm to decide\\nthe problem LSM (large stable models problem): does a logic program P have a stable\\nmodel of size at least |P | − k. In contrast, we show that the problem SSM (small stable\\nmodels problem) to decide whether a logic program P has a stable model of size at most\\nk is much harder. We present two algorithms for this problem but their running time is\\ngiven by polynomials of order depending on k. We show that the problem SSM is fixed-\\nparameter intractable by demonstrating that it is W [2]-hard. This result implies that it is\\nunlikely, an algorithm exists to compute stable models of size at most k that would run\\nin time O(nc), where c is a constant independent of k. We also provide an upper bound\\non the fixed-parameter complexity of the problem SSM by showing that it belongs to the\\nclass W [3].\\n\\n1 Introduction\\n\\nThe stable model semantics by Gelfond and Lifschitz [10] is one of the two most widely\\nstudied semantics for normal logic programs, the other one being the well-founded seman-\\ntics by Van Gelder, Ross and Schlipf [17]. Among 2-valued semantics, the stable model\\nsemantics is commonly regarded as the one providing the correct meaning to the negation\\noperator in logic programming. It coincides with the least model semantics on the class\\nof Horn programs, and with the well-founded semantics and the perfect model semantics\\non the class of stratified programs [1]. In addition, the stable model semantics is closely\\nrelated to the notion of a default extension by Reiter [12, 4]. Logic programming with sta-\\nble model semantics has applications in knowledge representation, planning and reasoning\\nabout action. It was also recently proposed as a computational paradigm especially well\\nsuited for solving combinatorial optimization and constraint satisfaction problems [14, 15].\\n\\nThe problem with the stable model semantics is that, even in the propositional case,\\nreasoning with logic programs under the stable model semantics is computationally hard. It\\nis well-known that deciding whether a finite propositional logic program has a stable model\\nis NP-complete [13]. Consequently, it is not at all clear that logic programming with the\\nstable model semantics can serve as a practical computational tool.\\n\\n1This is a full version of an extended abstract presented at the International Conference on Logic Pro-\\ngramming, ICLP-99 and included in the proceedings published by MIT Press.\\n\\n1\\n\\nhttp://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0002001v1\\n\\n\\nThis issue can be resolved by implementing systems computing stable models and by\\nexperimentally studying the performance of these systems. Several such projects are now\\nunder way. Niemelä and Simons [16] developed a system, smodels, for computing stable\\nmodels of finite function symbol-free logic programs and reported very promising perfor-\\nmance results. For some classes of programs, smodels decides the existence of a stable\\nmodel in a matter of seconds even if an input program consists of tens of thousands of\\nclauses. Encouraging results on using smodels to solve planning problems are reported\\nin [15]. Another well-advanced system is DeReS [6], designed to compute extensions of\\narbitrary propositional default theories but being especially effective for default theories\\nencoding propositional logic programs. Finally, systems capable of reasoning with disjunc-\\ntive logic programs were described in [9] and [2].\\n\\nHowever, faster implementations will ultimately depend on better understanding of the\\nalgorithmic aspects of reasoning with logic programs under the stable model semantics. In\\nthis paper, we investigate the complexity of deciding whether a finite propositional logic\\nprogram has stable models of some restricted sizes. Specifically, we study the following two\\nproblems (|P | stands for the number of rules in a logic program P ):\\n\\nLSM (Large stable models) Given a finite propositional logic program P and an integer k,\\ndecide whether there is a stable model of P of size at least |P | − k.\\n\\nSSM (Small stable models) Given a finite propositional logic program P and an integer k,\\ndecide whether there is a stable model of P of size no more than k.\\n\\nInputs to the problems LSM and SSM are pairs (P, k), where P is a finite propositional\\nlogic program and k is a non-negative integer. Problems of this type are referred to as\\nparametrized decision problems. By fixing a parameter, a parameterized decision problem\\ngives rise to its fixed-parameter version. In the case of problems LSM and SSM , by fixing k\\nwe obtain the following two fixed-parameter problems (k is now no longer a part of input):\\n\\n', metadata={'source': 'https://blobstoragejed5nzg3k2jp6.blob.core.windows.net/cord19/0002001v11.pdf'}),\n",

              "  Document(page_content='The initial cluster of severe pneumonia cases that triggered the 2019-nCoV epidemic was identified in Wuhan, China in December 2019. While early cases of the disease were linked to a wet market, human-to-human transmission has driven the rapid spread of the virus throughout China. The Chinese government has implemented containment strategies of city-wide lockdowns, screening at airports and train stations, and isolation of suspected patients; however, the cumulative case count keeps growing every day. The ongoing outbreak presents a challenge for modelers, as limited data are available on the early growth trajectory, and the epidemiological characteristics of the novel coronavirus are yet to be fully elucidated. We use phenomenological models that have been validated during previous outbreaks to generate and assess short-term forecasts of the cumulative number of confirmed reported cases in Hubei province, the epicenter of the epidemic, and for the overall trajectory in China, excluding the province of Hubei. We collect daily reported cumulative case data for the 2019-nCoV outbreak for each Chinese province from the National Health Commission of China. Here, we provide 5, 10, and 15 day forecasts for five consecutive days, February 5th through February 9th, with quantified uncertainty based on a generalized logistic growth model, the Richards growth model, and a sub-epidemic wave model. Our most recent forecasts reported here based on data up until February 9, 2020, largely agree across the three models presented and suggest an average range of 7,409 – 7,496 additional cases in Hubei and 1,128 – 1,929 additional cases in other provinces within the next five days. Models also predict an average total cumulative case count between 37,415 – 38,028 in Hubei and 11,588 – 13,499 in other provinces by February 24, 2020. Mean estimates and uncertainty bounds for both Hubei and other provinces have remained relatively stable in the last three reporting dates (February 7th – 9th). We also observe that each of the models predicts that the epidemic has reached saturation in both Hubei and other provinces. Our findings suggest that the containment strategies implemented in China are successfully reducing transmission and that the epidemic growth has slowed in recent days.', metadata={'source': 'https://blobstoragejed5nzg3k2jp6.blob.core.windows.net/csv/all_sources_metadata.csv'}),\n",

Thus, the union of the last three\\nsets of clauses in the definition of T (P ) is logically equivalent to the theory T0(P ). It follows\\nthat U ⊆ {c(q): q ∈ At} ∪ {c(q, i): q ∈M, 1 ≤ i ≤ k + 1} ∪ {c−(q, i): q ∈M, 2 ≤ i ≤ k + 1}\\nis a model of T0(P ) if and only if U ∪{d(q, i): c(q) ∈ U, 1 ≤ i ≤ k2 +2k} is a model of T (P ).\\nMoreover, every model of T (P ) is of the form U ∪{d(q, i): c(q) ∈ U, 1 ≤ i ≤ k2 +2k}, where\\nU ⊆ {c(q): q ∈ At} ∪ {c(q, i): q ∈ M, 1 ≤ i ≤ k + 1} ∪ {c−(q, i): q ∈ M, 2 ≤ i ≤ k + 1} is a\\nmodel of T0(P ).\\n\\nThe role of the clauses in the sets C0(q) is to decrease the effect of the atoms c−(q, i)\\nand c(q, i) on the size of models of T (P ). Consequently, given a model U of T0(P ), we\\ncan derive a bound on |{q ∈ At(P ): c(q) ∈ U}| from a bound on the size of the model of\\nT (P ) corresponding to U .
